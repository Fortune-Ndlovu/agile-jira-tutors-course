# What is a Jira Project and Why is it Useful?

In Jira, a project is a space where you manage tasks, bugs, stories, and other work related to a specific goal or product. Projects are essential because they:

- Help teams organize and track work in one place.
- Allow customization of workflows, issue types, and permissions.
- Provide visibility into progress and team activity.

Each Jira project comes with its own board (e.g., Kanban or Scrum) to visualize tasks and progress, making it an essential foundation for managing team work efficiently.

### Step 3: Choose a Project Template
Jira will prompt you to choose a project template. Each template is tailored to specific needs:

- **Kanban**: Best for continuous workflows, where work items move freely between columns.
- **Scrum**: Ideal for teams working in sprints with planned, iterative releases.
- **Team-managed**: If you're setting up for a smaller team with simpler processes.
- **Company-managed**: For larger teams requiring more customization.

For most beginners, Kanban is a great starting point. Select **Kanban** and click Next.

### Step 4: Name Your Project
Youâ€™ll be asked to name your project. Choose a name that reflects your team's work, such as **"Website Redesign"** or **"Product Development."**

Jira will auto-generate a project key (a short identifier for the project). You can customize this if needed, but the default key works fine.

### Step 5: Select a Project Type
Jira offers **Team-managed** and **Company-managed** projects. For simplicity:

- Choose **Team-managed** if you want an easy setup with less customization.
- Choose **Company-managed** for more advanced control and permissions.

For beginners, **Team-managed** is a good start. Select your preference and click **Create Project**.

### Step 6: Your Project is Ready
Once you click **Create Project**, Jira will generate your project, and you'll be taken to the project dashboard.

This dashboard includes features like a **Kanban board**, issue creation tools, and project settings to manage your work.
